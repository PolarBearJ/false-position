# false-position
This is a program that approximates the roots of functions using the false-position method. This method is like Bisection but Instead of dividing the interval in half, a straight line is drawn between x0 and x1. The intersection with the x-axis, xm, represents the point that divides the two subintervals. 

You may want to change the function that you are approximating, to do so change what "d" is equal to in the "drag" function. (Line 50)
Additionally, you can change the error value to a desired degree of error. By deffault it is set to 0.00001 % error
